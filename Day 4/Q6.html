        <h3>Question 6:<br>
            Rewrite the function using '?' or '||'<br>Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.<br>The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.<br>Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</h3>
